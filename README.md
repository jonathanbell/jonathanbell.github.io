# Curriculum Vitae of Jonathan Bell

My online résumé. :)

Please feel free to use this as a template for your own Gatsby based résumé but please remember to change the content, thank you.

## Install

Pretty basic [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) stuff:

1. Install Gatsby globally: `npm install --global gatsby-cli`
1. `git clone https://github.com/jonathanbell/jonathanbell.github.io.git`
1. `cd jonathanbell.github.io.git`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev` to develop and `npm run build` when you are ready to build the Gatsby (static) site

## Deploying

This site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the [gh-pages Gatsby plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/) in order to deploy to <https://jonathanbell.github.io/>.

GitHub requires that the `master` branch be used for static files in the case of a "personal" or "organization" page. As such, be sure to edit code on the `gatsby-source` branch and then run `npm run deploy` in order to deploy automatically to the `master` branch.

My online résumé. :)

Please feel free to use this as a template for your own HTML résumé but remember to change the content, please and thank you.

## Install

To get started, basically just install Node and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) and then:

* ```git clone https://github.com/jonathanbell/cv.jonathanbell.ca.git```
* ```npm install```
* ```bower install```

Then edit the content, ```grunt``` and upload! :)

## But... There's a FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)

Yeah, I know. [Apparently, it's preferred](https://css-tricks.com/loading-web-fonts-with-the-web-font-loader/#article-header-id-5) to FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text), nowadays.

I'm proud to say however, that this webpage scores a 99/100 on [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjonathanbell.github.io%2F&tab=desktop).

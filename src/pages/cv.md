## Experience

### User Experience Design; Developer

_March 2015 to April 2018, Ministry of Education, BC Public Service, Victoria BC_

As lead developer, created a Laravel-based web application that allowed the public to view British Columbia school and school district data in graphical forms. Previously this data was only available in tabular formats and, as such, was difficult for the public to interpret.

Maintained, updated and developed internet and intranet facing content management systems using Drupal/PHP, jQuery/Javascript, MySQL/Oracle, and CSS by developing custom modules that allowed content owners easier publication and curation of their content on BC government web properties.

Developed new Git "push to deploy" source control workflow for my web team, thus cutting down deployment time significantly and reducing human error while deploying new code to production or staging environments.

### Web Developer

_July 2014 to Febuary 2015, Ministry of Advanced Education, BC Public Service, Victoria BC_

Connected front-end user interactions to back-end credit checking API during the student loan application process. While working on a team, converted the old (paper-based) student loan application process to a new web-based loan application process. This change cut a student's loan application response time down to approximately one day verses weeks of waiting for a paper response in the mail.

### Web Developer, Freelance

_January 2014 to present_

Designed, built and implemented front-end solutions for new social media based corporate intranet with Drupal backend. The new intranet allowed workers to collaborate more effectively and easily share ideas about upcoming work, thus reducing replicated work and improving communication around projects; a sometimes difficult task inside an organization of over 30,000 people.

Realized new functionality from mockups and wireframes while developing new custom responsive theme for Drupal site, preserving all original content and adapting it to small screen sizes. This allowed users to use the site while commuting or while out of the office at events, etc. This increased the traffic and engagement of the site by over 15%.

Design, build and maintain custom websites and web apps for small businesses and corporate bodies.

Meet expectations of clients while expanding knowledge of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications, accessibility best practices, and network performance/speed gains.

## Education

### Communication and Creative Advertising

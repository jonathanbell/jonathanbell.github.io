## Taking a Coding Sabbatical

I did it! I left my secure job. I even left without having another job lined up. My dad told me never to do that (sorry, dad).

The plan for the next 3 months is to accept only small jobs and to study _a lot_ in my spare time. I want to level up my JavaScript skills and to eventually get a local or remote position with a company that I find engaging and inclusive.

I feel like quitting my job was necessary as I simply did not have enough time available during the day in order to study and work. I need several hours a day free and clear if I'm to be efficient. Web developers constantly need to be learning these days. Every time you turn around there is a new framework or a new tool or a new best practice bandwagon that we should all be jumping on. It's very hard to keep up - I'm sure that you agree.

It's not surprising that the [2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/) found that developers really want code and that they want to learn on the job while doing it.

I was nervous to take the plunge. Living on savings and having no stable income can be scary but so far (2 weeks in) I am really enjoying having the time available to study. I study a lot and work remotely part-time for a small company. I guess I am [not the first person to do this](https://www.quora.com/Im-thinking-about-taking-a-3-month-sabbatical-to-learn-to-code-and-dont-want-to-pay-10-12k-for-a-bootcamp-Has-anyone-taught-themselves-to-code-this-quickly-and-gotten-a-job). Reading about [other developers who have done the same thing](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/114424/how-do-you-address-the-gap-on-your-resume-after-a-self-funded-sabbatical) was encouraging. I have even planned out [a small curriculum](https://github.com/jonathanbell/notes/projects/1) for myself in order to keep myself accountable.

I don't know what the future holds! Perhaps I will live to regret this. I am obviously still nervous - whatever happens though I will update this post in about 3 months time with the results of my sabbatical.

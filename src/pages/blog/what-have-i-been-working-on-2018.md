## What Have I Been Working On? (2018 Edition)

Since I left my government job over 6 months ago, a lot of people have been asking me, "What have you been up to?" It's a fair question. My life as a contractor/student has been busy and quiet all at the same time. I've decided to start looking for full-time employment in November of this year (2018). I hope that until then I will have enough time to study all of the things that I want to (there's just never enough time!).

Anyways, this is a post that I hope to update periodically until the end of 2018. I think that I will make a post like this every year from now on. It's really handy to have and nice to look back on things that you've accomplished throughout the year. I just want to simply list out the things that I have been working on over the year and update them as time moves on. Next year I will be sure to create a post like this near the start of the year and keep adding to it throughout the year. However this year, I am a little tardy (it's October right now!).
